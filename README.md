#Built for students, NOT for profit. See below how we put student’s first in our design.

A message from the founders:

We want to be transparent with our customers. We are not strictly in this for the money, apps actually take a lot of capital to create, and to keep the lights on. This is why we offer a FREE version with ads. We appreciate you no matter your subscription choice!
